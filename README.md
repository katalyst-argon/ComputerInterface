# Computer Interface
Computer Interface is a library for Gorilla Tag which replaces the base computer with a custom computer, and allows developers to add functionality to it.

# Install
- The recommended way to install Computer Interface is through THIS GITHUB --- katalyst-argon

# CommandLine
Computer Interface ships with a CLI that enables you to execute routines & change settings.

Information on creating commands can be found in the Adding Your Own Commands section.

By default Computer Interface ships with the following commands:

- setcolor int int int
Changes your gorilla's color (e.g. setcolor 255 255 255)
- setname string
Changes your gorilla's name (e.g. setname toni)
- join string
Connects to a room code (e.g. join dev123)
- leave
Disconnects you from the current room
- cam string
Changes your spectator camera's perspective to either First Person (fp) or Third Person (tp)
- setbg int int int
Changes your computer's background color (e.g. setbg 40 70 40)
- resetbg
Resets the computer's background.
# Background
To use a custom background image:

- Go to your Gorilla Tag folder, and open BepInEx/config/tonimacaroni.computerinterface.cfg.
- Find the ScreenBackgroundPath config option, and replace the path with your own image path.
- Use forward slashes (/) instead of backslashes (\) in the path
- Your background will be multiplied by the background's color
- Paths can either be relative to your Gorilla Tag folder or absolute.
- As of Computer Interface version 1.9.0, using the resetbg makes it easier to change you background without the need to restart your game.
- You can also run setbg 255 255 255 to leave the background with no modified color.

- Additional Features
- Command Line
- Ability to toggle supported mods on and off
- Animated keys
- Custom background (Image & Color)
# For Developers
Before you begin reading I have created a very well-documented example mod which you can use as a starting point.
It shows examples for creating multiple views, navigating between those and creating your own commands:

For more advanced examples check out the base library views here:

# Adding Views
Computer Interface works with "Views" which are classes that inherit from ComputerView or IComputerView.

Views can navigate to others views through ShowView<TargetView>(), or return to the main menu with ReturnToMainMenu().
Views can check for key presses by overriding OnKeyPressed.

An example view may look like this:

```
public class ExampleView : ComputerView {
    // Called when the view is opened by the user.
    public override void OnShow(object[] args) {
        base.OnShow(args);
        
        // A 'Redraw' method is usually made for easier reading.
        Redraw();
    }
    
    // The method that usually handles the text on the screen.
    private void Redraw() {
        // A StringBuilder is usually made for easy text making.
        var stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
        
        // Uses the top of the screen to showoff what tab you are currently on.
        stringBuilder.BeginCenter().Repeat("=", SCREEN_WIDTH).AppendLine();
        stringBuilder.Append("Example Tab").AppendLine();
        stringBuilder.Repeat("=", SCREEN_WIDTH).EndAlign().AppendLines(2);
        
        // Makes text below the "titlebar".
        stringBuilder.AppendLine("Computer Interface Example!");
        
        Text = stringBuilder.ToString();
    }

    // When a key on the keyboard is pressed, the key pressed is sent back as a parameter to be used.
    public override void OnKeyPressed(EKeyboardKey key) {
        switch (key) {
            case EKeyboardKey.Back:
                // 'ReturnToMainMenu();' is used to return to the MainMenuView.
                // 'ShowView<ViewToShow>();' can be used to switch to another view.
                ReturnToMainMenu();
                break;
            case EKeyboardKey.Option1:
                // 'ShowView<TargetView>();' can be used to switch to another view.
                ShowView<ExampleHelpView>();
                break;
        }
    }
}
```
To add a view to the main menu, you need to create a Mod Entry, and Computer Interface will automatically detect it on launch.
Mod Entries must implement IComputerModEntry, and provide the name type of the view to be shown.

For example:

```
// A selectable entry on the MainMenuView.
// Entries are automatically detected by ComputerInterface.
public class ExampleViewEntry : IComputerModEntry {
    // The name of the entry that will be shown.
    public string EntryName => "Example";
    
    // The first view that the user is going to see when selecting your entry.
    public Type EntryViewType => typeof(ExampleView);
}
```
Adding Your Own Commands
Adding your own CLI commands is easy - create a class that inherits ICommandRegistrar, and Computer Interface will automatically detect it on launch.

For example:

```
public class ExampleCommandManager : ICommandRegistrar {
    private CommandHandler _commandHandler;
    
    public void Initialize() {
        // Request the CommandHandler.
        _commandHandler = CommandHandler.Singleton;

        RegisterCommands();
    }

    public void RegisterCommands() {
        // Register your commands.
        
        // You can set 'argumentTypes' to null if you aren't going to have any.
        _commandHandler.AddCommand(new Command(name: "monke", argumentTypes: null, arguments => {
            // Arguments are an array of strings passed when entering the command.
            // The CommandHandler already checks if the correct amount of arguments is passed.
            
            // The string you return is going to be shown in the terminal as a return message.
            // You can break up the message into multiple lines by using '\n'
            return "MONKE";
        }));
    }
}
```
This used a dummy class ExampleCommandManager, but of course, you can do this in any type as long as you request the CommandHandler.
